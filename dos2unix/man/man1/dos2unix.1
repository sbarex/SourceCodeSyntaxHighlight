.SH "NAME"
dos2unix \- DOS/Mac to Unix and vice versa text file format converter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    dos2unix [options] [FILE ...] [\-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
\&    unix2dos [options] [FILE ...] [\-n INFILE OUTFILE ...]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Dos2unix package includes utilities \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unix2dos\*(C'\fR to convert
plain text files in \s-1DOS\s0 or Mac format to Unix format and vice versa.
.PP
In DOS/Windows text files a line break, also known as newline, is a combination
of two characters: a Carriage Return (\s-1CR\s0) followed by a Line Feed (\s-1LF\s0). In Unix
text files a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (\s-1LF\s0). In Mac text
files, prior to Mac \s-1OS X,\s0 a line break was single Carriage Return (\s-1CR\s0)
character. Nowadays Mac \s-1OS\s0 uses Unix style (\s-1LF\s0) line breaks.
.PP
Besides line breaks Dos2unix can also convert the encoding of files. A few
\&\s-1DOS\s0 code pages can be converted to Unix Latin\-1. And Windows Unicode (\s-1UTF\-16\s0)
files can be converted to Unix Unicode (\s-1UTF\-8\s0) files.
.PP
Binary files are automatically skipped, unless conversion is forced.
.PP
Non-regular files, such as directories and FIFOs, are automatically skipped.
.PP
Symbolic links and their targets are by default kept untouched.  Symbolic links
can optionally be replaced, or the output can be written to the symbolic link
target.  Writing to a symbolic link target is not supported on Windows.
.PP
Dos2unix was modelled after dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris.  There is one
important difference with the original SunOS/Solaris version. This version does
by default in-place conversion (old file mode), while the original
SunOS/Solaris version only supports paired conversion (new file mode). See also
options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. Another difference is that the SunOS/Solaris version
uses by default \fIiso\fR mode conversion while this version uses by default \fIascii\fR
mode conversion.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "--"
Treat all following options as file names. Use this option if you want to
convert files whose names start with a dash. For instance to convert
a file named \*(L"\-foo\*(R", you can use this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-\- \-foo
.Ve
.Sp
Or in new file mode:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-n \-\- \-foo out.txt
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-allow\-chown\fR" 4
.IX Item "--allow-chown"
Allow file ownership change in old file mode.
.Sp
When this option is used, the conversion will not be aborted when the user
and/or group ownership of the original file can't be preserved in old file
mode. Conversion will continue and the converted file will get the same new
ownership as if it was converted in new file mode. See also options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. This option is only available if dos2unix has support for preserving
the user and group ownership of files.
.IP "\fB\-ascii\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ascii"
Convert only line breaks. This is the default conversion mode.
.IP "\fB\-iso\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iso"
Conversion between \s-1DOS\s0 and \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 character set. See also section
\&\s-1CONVERSION MODES.\s0
.IP "\fB\-1252\fR" 4
.IX Item "-1252"
Use Windows code page 1252 (Western European).
.IP "\fB\-437\fR" 4
.IX Item "-437"
Use \s-1DOS\s0 code page 437 (\s-1US\s0). This is the default code page used for \s-1ISO\s0 conversion.
.IP "\fB\-850\fR" 4
.IX Item "-850"
Use \s-1DOS\s0 code page 850 (Western European).
.IP "\fB\-860\fR" 4
.IX Item "-860"
Use \s-1DOS\s0 code page 860 (Portuguese).
.IP "\fB\-863\fR" 4
.IX Item "-863"
Use \s-1DOS\s0 code page 863 (French Canadian).
.IP "\fB\-865\fR" 4
.IX Item "-865"
Use \s-1DOS\s0 code page 865 (Nordic).
.IP "\fB\-7\fR" 4
.IX Item "-7"
Convert 8 bit characters to 7 bit space.
.IP "\fB\-b, \-\-keep\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b, --keep-bom"
Keep Byte Order Mark (\s-1BOM\s0). When the input file has a \s-1BOM,\s0 write a \s-1BOM\s0 in
the output file. This is the default behavior when converting to \s-1DOS\s0 line
breaks. See also option \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-c, \-\-convmode \s-1CONVMODE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --convmode CONVMODE"
Set conversion mode. Where \s-1CONVMODE\s0 is one of:
\&\fIascii\fR, \fI7bit\fR, \fIiso\fR, \fImac\fR
with ascii being the default.
.IP "\fB\-D, \-\-display\-enc \s-1ENCODING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D, --display-enc ENCODING"
Set encoding of displayed text. Where \s-1ENCODING\s0 is one of:
\&\fIansi\fR, \fIunicode\fR, \fIunicodebom\fR, \fIutf8\fR, \fIutf8bom\fR
with ansi being the default.
.Sp
This option is only available in dos2unix for Windows with Unicode
file name support. This option has no effect on the actual file names
read and written, only on how they are displayed.
.Sp
There are several methods for displaying text in a Windows console based on the
encoding of the text. They all have their own advantages and disadvantages.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "ansi"
Dos2unix's default method is to use \s-1ANSI\s0 encoded text. The advantage is that it
is backwards compatible. It works with raster and TrueType fonts. In some
regions you may need to change the active \s-1DOS OEM\s0 code page to the Windows
system \s-1ANSI\s0 code page using the \f(CW\*(C`chcp\*(C'\fR command, because dos2unix uses the
Windows system code page.
.Sp
The disadvantage of ansi is that international file names with characters not
inside the system default code page are not displayed properly. You will
see a question mark, or a wrong symbol instead. When you don't work with
foreign file names this method is \s-1OK.\s0
.IP "\fBunicode, unicodebom\fR" 4
.IX Item "unicode, unicodebom"
The advantage of unicode (the Windows name for \s-1UTF\-16\s0) encoding is that text is
usually properly displayed. There is no need to change the active code page.
You may need to set the console's font to a TrueType font to have international
characters displayed properly. When a character is not included in the TrueType
font you usually see a small square, sometimes with a question mark in it.
.Sp
When you use the ConEmu console all text is displayed properly, because ConEmu
automatically selects a good font.
.Sp
The disadvantage of unicode is that it is not compatible with \s-1ASCII.\s0 The output
is not easy to handle when you redirect it to another program.
.Sp
When method \f(CW\*(C`unicodebom\*(C'\fR is used the Unicode text will be preceded with a \s-1BOM\s0
(Byte Order Mark). A \s-1BOM\s0 is required for correct redirection or piping in
PowerShell.
.IP "\fButf8, utf8bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "utf8, utf8bom"
The advantage of utf8 is that it is compatible with \s-1ASCII.\s0 You need to set the
console's font to a TrueType font. With a TrueType font the text is displayed
similar as with the \f(CW\*(C`unicode\*(C'\fR encoding.
.Sp
The disadvantage is that when you use the default raster font all non-ASCII
characters are displayed wrong. Not only unicode file names, but also
translated messages become unreadable. On Windows configured for an East-Asian
region you may see a lot of flickering of the console when the messages are
displayed.
.Sp
In a ConEmu console the utf8 encoding method works well.
.Sp
When method \f(CW\*(C`utf8bom\*(C'\fR is used the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 text will be preceded with a \s-1BOM\s0
(Byte Order Mark). A \s-1BOM\s0 is required for correct redirection or piping in
PowerShell.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The default encoding can be changed with environment variable \s-1DOS2UNIX_DISPLAY_ENC\s0
by setting it to \f(CW\*(C`unicode\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`unicodebom\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`utf8bom\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --force"
Force conversion of binary files.
.IP "\fB\-gb, \-\-gb18030\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gb, --gb18030"
On Windows \s-1UTF\-16\s0 files are by default converted to \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 regardless of the
locale setting. Use this option to convert \s-1UTF\-16\s0 files to \s-1GB18030.\s0 This option
is only available on Windows. See also section \s-1GB18030.\s0
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Display help and exit.
.IP "\fB\-i[\s-1FLAGS\s0], \-\-info[=FLAGS] \s-1FILE ...\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i[FLAGS], --info[=FLAGS] FILE ..."
Display file information. No conversion is done.
.Sp
The following information is printed, in this order: number of \s-1DOS\s0 line breaks,
number of Unix line breaks, number of Mac line breaks, byte order mark, text

.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-add\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --add-bom"
Write a Byte Order Mark (\s-1BOM\s0) in the output file. By default an \s-1UTF\-8 BOM\s0
is written.
.Sp
When the input file is \s-1UTF\-16,\s0 and the option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR is used, an \s-1UTF\-16
BOM\s0 will be written.
.Sp
Never use this option when the output encoding is other than \s-1UTF\-8, UTF\-16,\s0 or
\&\s-1GB18030.\s0 See also section \s-1UNICODE.\s0
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-newfile \s-1INFILE OUTFILE ...\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --newfile INFILE OUTFILE ..."
New file mode. Convert file \s-1INFILE\s0 and write output to file \s-1OUTFILE.\s0
File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should \fInot\fR be
used or you \fIwill\fR lose your files.
.Sp
The person who starts the conversion in new file (paired) mode will be the owner
of the converted file. The read/write permissions of the new file will be the
permissions of the original file minus the \fBumask\fR\|(1) of the person who runs the
conversion.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-allow\-chown\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-allow-chown"
Don't allow file ownership change in old file mode (default).
.Sp
Abort conversion when the user and/or group ownership of the original file
can't be preserved in old file mode. See also options \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR. This
option is only available if dos2unix has support for preserving the user
and group ownership of files.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-oldfile \s-1FILE ...\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --oldfile FILE ..."
Old file mode. Convert file \s-1FILE\s0 and overwrite output to it. The program
defaults to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.
.Sp
In old file (in-place) mode the converted file gets the same owner, group, and
read/write permissions as the original file. Also when the file is converted by
another user who has write permissions on the file (e.g. user root).  The
conversion will be aborted when it is not possible to preserve the original
values.  Change of owner could mean that the original owner is not able to read
the file any more. Change of group could be a security risk, the file could be
made readable for persons for whom it is not intended.  Preservation of owner,
group, and read/write permissions is only supported on Unix.
.Sp
To check if dos2unix has support for preserving the user and group ownership of
files type \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Conversion is always done via a temporary file. When an error occurs halfway
the conversion, the temporary file is deleted and the original file stays
intact. When the conversion is successful, the original file is replaced with
the temporary file. You may have write permission on the original file, but no
permission to put the same user and/or group ownership properties on the
temporary file as the original file has. This means you are not able to
preserve the user and/or group ownership of the original file. In this case you
can use option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-allow\-chown\*(C'\fR to continue with the conversion:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-\-allow\-chown foo.txt
.Ve
.Sp
Another option is to use new file mode:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    dos2unix \-n foo.txt foo.txt
.Ve
.Sp
The advantage of the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-allow\-chown\*(C'\fR option is that you can use wildcards,
and the ownership properties will be preserved when possible.
.IP "\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Quiet mode. Suppress all warnings and messages. The return value is zero.
Except when wrong command-line options are used.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-remove\-bom\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --remove-bom"
Remove Byte Order Mark (\s-1BOM\s0). Do not write a \s-1BOM\s0 in the output file.
This is the default behavior when converting to Unix line breaks.
See also option \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s, \-\-safe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --safe"
Skip binary files (default).
.Sp
The skipping of binary files is done to avoid accidental mistakes. Be aware
that the detection of binary files is not 100% foolproof. Input files are
scanned for binary symbols which are typically not found in text files. It is
possible that a binary file contains only normal text characters. Such a binary
file will mistakenly be seen as a text file.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-keep\-utf16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u, --keep-utf16"
Keep the original \s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoding of the input file. The output file will be
written in the same \s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoding, little or big endian, as the input file.
This prevents transformation to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 An \s-1UTF\-16 BOM\s0 will be written
accordingly. This option can be disabled with the \f(CW\*(C`\-ascii\*(C'\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-ul, \-\-assume\-utf16le\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ul, --assume-utf16le"
Assume that the input file format is \s-1UTF\-16LE.\s0
.Sp
When there is a Byte Order Mark in the input file the \s-1BOM\s0 has priority over
this option.
.Sp
When you made a wrong assumption (the input file was not in \s-1UTF\-16LE\s0 format) and
the conversion succeeded, you will get an \s-1UTF\-8\s0 output file with wrong text.
You can undo the wrong conversion with \fBiconv\fR\|(1) by converting the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 output
file back to \s-1UTF\-16LE.\s0 This will bring back the original file.
.Sp
The assumption of \s-1UTF\-16LE\s0 works as a \fIconversion mode\fR. By switching to the default
\&\fIascii\fR mode the \s-1UTF\-16LE\s0 assumption is turned off.
.IP "\fB\-ub, \-\-assume\-utf16be\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ub, --assume-utf16be"
Assume that the input file format is \s-1UTF\-16BE.\s0
.Sp
This option works the same as option \f(CW\*(C`\-ul\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR" 4

mode.
.Sp
Although the name of this mode is \s-1ASCII,\s0 which is a 7 bit standard, the
actual mode is 8 bit. Use always this mode when converting Unicode \s-1UTF\-8\s0
files.
.IP "\fB7bit\fR" 4
.IX Item "7bit"
In this mode all 8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to 255)
are converted to a 7 bit space.
.IP "\fBiso\fR" 4
.IX Item "iso"
Characters are converted between a \s-1DOS\s0 character set (code page) and \s-1ISO\s0
character set \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 (Latin\-1) on Unix. \s-1DOS\s0 characters without \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0
equivalent, for which conversion is not possible, are converted to a dot. The
same counts for \s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0 characters without \s-1DOS\s0 counterpart.
.Sp
When only option \f(CW\*(C`\-iso\*(C'\fR is used dos2unix will try to determine the active code

which is mainly used in the \s-1USA.\s0  To force a specific code page use options
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-437\*(C'\fR (\s-1US\s0), \f(CW\*(C`\-850\*(C'\fR (Western European), \f(CW\*(C`\-860\*(C'\fR (Portuguese), \f(CW\*(C`\-863\*(C'\fR (French
Canadian), or \f(CW\*(C`\-865\*(C'\fR (Nordic).  Windows code page \s-1CP1252\s0 (Western European) is
also supported with option \f(CW\*(C`\-1252\*(C'\fR. For other code pages use dos2unix in
combination with \fBiconv\fR\|(1).  Iconv can convert between a long list of character
encodings.

.SH "UNICODE"
.IX Header "UNICODE"
.SS "Encodings"
.IX Subsection "Encodings"
There exist different Unicode encodings. On Unix and Linux Unicode files are
typically encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding. On Windows Unicode text files can be
encoded in \s-1UTF\-8, UTF\-16,\s0 or \s-1UTF\-16\s0 big endian, but are mostly encoded in
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 format.
.SS "Conversion"
.IX Subsection "Conversion"
Unicode text files can have \s-1DOS,\s0 Unix or Mac line breaks, like regular text
files.
.PP
All versions of dos2unix and unix2dos can convert \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded files, because
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 was designed for backward compatibility with \s-1ASCII.\s0
.PP
Dos2unix and unix2dos with Unicode \s-1UTF\-16\s0 support, can read little and big
endian \s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoded text files. To see if dos2unix was built with \s-1UTF\-16\s0
support type \f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On Unix/Linux \s-1UTF\-16\s0 encoded files are converted to the locale character
encoding. Use the \fBlocale\fR\|(1) command to find out what the locale character
encoding is. When conversion is not possible a conversion error will occur and
the file will be skipped.
.PP
On Windows \s-1UTF\-16\s0 files are by default converted to \s-1UTF\-8. UTF\-8\s0 formatted
text files are well supported on both Windows and Unix/Linux.
.PP
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 and \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoding are fully compatible, there will no text be lost in
the conversion. When an \s-1UTF\-16\s0 to \s-1UTF\-8\s0 conversion error occurs, for instance
when the \s-1UTF\-16\s0 input file contains an error, the file will be skipped.
.PP
When option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR is used, the output file will be written in the same \s-1UTF\-16\s0
encoding as the input file. Option \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR prevents conversion to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.PP
Dos2unix and unix2dos have no option to convert \s-1UTF\-8\s0 files to \s-1UTF\-16.\s0
.PP
\&\s-1ISO\s0 and 7\-bit mode conversion do not work on \s-1UTF\-16\s0 files.
.SS "Byte Order Mark"
.IX Subsection "Byte Order Mark"
On Windows Unicode text files typically have a Byte Order Mark (\s-1BOM\s0), because
many Windows programs (including Notepad) add BOMs by default. See also
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark>.
.PP
On Unix Unicode files typically don't have a \s-1BOM.\s0 It is assumed that text files
are encoded in the locale character encoding.
.PP
Dos2unix can only detect if a file is in \s-1UTF\-16\s0 format if the file has a \s-1BOM.\s0
When an \s-1UTF\-16\s0 file doesn't have a \s-1BOM,\s0 dos2unix will see the file as a binary
file.
.PP
Use option \f(CW\*(C`\-ul\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-ub\*(C'\fR to convert an \s-1UTF\-16\s0 file without \s-1BOM.\s0
.PP
Dos2unix writes by default no \s-1BOM\s0 in the output file. With option \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR
Dos2unix writes a \s-1BOM\s0 when the input file has a \s-1BOM.\s0
.PP
Unix2dos writes by default a \s-1BOM\s0 in the output file when the input file has a
\&\s-1BOM.\s0 Use option \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR to remove the \s-1BOM.\s0
.PP
Dos2unix and unix2dos write always a \s-1BOM\s0 when option \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR is used.
.SS "Unicode file names on Windows"
.IX Subsection "Unicode file names on Windows"
Dos2unix has optional support for reading and writing Unicode file names in the
Windows Command Prompt. That means that dos2unix can open files that have
characters in the name that are not part of the default system \s-1ANSI\s0 code page.
To see if dos2unix for Windows was built with Unicode file name support type
\&\f(CW\*(C`dos2unix \-V\*(C'\fR.
.PP
There are some issues with displaying Unicode file names in a Windows console.
See option \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-display\-enc\*(C'\fR. The file names may be displayed wrongly in
the console, but the files will be written with the correct name.
